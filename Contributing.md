## Adding to this list

If you want something to be included on `awesome-metaverse-cybersecurity`, try to only add actual awesome stuff in your [pull requests](https://github.com/keyfri/awesome-metaverse-cybersecurity/pulls). After all, it's a curation, not a collection.

## Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Please only add/remove one (1) item per commit.
- Please ensure your items are formatted consistently with the rest, e.g. as  `[List Name](link) - description.`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Please update the table of contents as needed.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Self-promotion can be okay, but _only_ if you clearly state your involvement.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Finally, **thanks for your suggestions!**
